        My father migrated from England with his parents and siblings when he was still a teenager, my mother was born in Australia with her paternal lineage migrating from England in the early 1800’s as a tradesperson. I was born in Northern NSW and grew up in the NSW high country of the New England region. I completed high school and started a Commerce degree at the University of New England, but I couldn’t juggle work, study and life at the time. I’m back studying now that I’m in a better position to succeed. I’m also a musician, songwriter and producer. I sang in a metal band in London UK, and toured the East Cost of Australia with an electronic shoegaze band called No Body Died. These days I release electro pop music under my own name Jay Westfold, minimal ambient techno under the name Broken Ballerina, and play synths in a post-punk band. To date my music has received over 50k streams on Spotify and Apple Music.

              <p>
              When I was a child my family had a Vic-20 which was upgraded to a Commodore-64, but it was a family friend who was a computer technician that first introduced me to computers properly, explaining hardware and DOS commands,  and I've been exploring the world of IT since and it is everywhere.
              <br>
              <br>
              I currently work in an IT related position as a Business Systems Analyst at RMIT University and have been working with computers for over 20 years, but I don't have any formal qualifications. So it seems like the best opportunity I have ever had to chase away some self-doubt, fill in some knowledge gaps, learn some new things, ensure my career doesn’t stagnate and keep my skills relevant.
              <br>
              <br>
              By studying at RMIT, I feel like I’m supporting the university that is currently supporting me as an employee, it was an easy choice to study at RMIT.
              <br>
              <br>
              I’m a bit of an all-rounder, I know how to do a lot of things in the world of IT, but I’m not a master at any of them. I’m hoping through the Bachelor of Information Technology I discover an area that piques my interest and I can work at mastering it.

              <h2>Senior Analyst – Strategy and Implementation</h2>
                <h3>Description</h3>
                  <p>
                  The <a href="https://au.linkedin.com/jobs/view/senior-analyst-strategy-and-implementation-at-bunnings-2929585735" target="_blank">Senior Analyst - Strategy and Implementation</a> role is a strategic roll at Bunnings, analysing the existing business needs, sales targets, systems and processes currently in place, working with many stakeholders including a dedicated Salesforce CRM team, Operations and Sales Teams and designing a Sales Pipeline and Reporting function that is fit for purpose.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  The Bunnings brand isn’t a massive drawcard for this job, its all about the role. The possibility of leading and working on a strategic systems based project from start to finish is what I find most appealing. The role has many similarities to a User Experience Developer but with a more Business based focus. From scoping out the initial needs, researching and putting together a business case and proposal and then delivering the end product is the level I would like to aim for.

              <h2>Results</h2>
                <h3>Meaning</h3>
                <p>
                I consider myself to be emotionally intelligent, it hasn’t always been the case, but I have learnt and continue to learn about myself and how I interact with the environment and the people I encounter every day. I am aware that I am introverted, but I also know that I have strong social and communication skills. I’m aware that I often underplay my achievements and have a hard time accepting compliments from others, but being aware of it allows me the chance to improve and get better at it. I was a little surprised with the Learning style assessment results, I find I’m much better with written instructions and being allowed the time to explore concepts and information on my own first, but hearing and listening is a great way of validating information for me. So I don’t think it is a clear cut as being an Auditory learner, I think a combination of styles suits me best. On the final test that I tried, I am told that I am seen as the Lively Centre of Attention by others, if that is true than I am quietly surprised, but maybe that is the point.
                </p>
                <h3>Behaviours</h3>
                <p>
                Different personality types work differently with each other in teams, being aware and conscious of other personality and learning types as well as your own will give you the best chance of succeeding in a team situation. However having complimentary personality and learning types together in teams, not all the same types of people, would be the best way of ensuring success.
                </p>
                <h3>Forming A Team</h3>
                <p>
                On any project different tasks can be suited to people with different skills and personality traits and types of learning. When forming a team, I will be trying to find team members that compliment my own traits, skills and learning type. For instance, I’m not someone that would be the first person to stand up in front of a group of people and present my findings from these tests. I would more likely be someone who observes others first and when I am comfortable and have a better understanding of the people in the room and I feel safe, I will then be able to present. So I will be drawn to more balanced, introverted and reserved people rather than extroverted people as I will have more confidence that I will have space and time to contribute and use my experience to get the best out of myself and the wider team.
