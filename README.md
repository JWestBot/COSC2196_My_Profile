# Introduction to Information Technology, Assessment Task 1, My Profile.

# Description

In this assignment you will develop your IT profile, which will be used as an input to further assignments. This is an individual assignment, and you will present your assignment by setting up a website which will contain the information about you.

Your work needs to constitute a self-contained document that makes sense without the reader referring to the marking specification to understand the meaning of the information that you are communicating.

Your assignment will be marked out of 100, as described in the rubric below. With English Expression being taken into account throughout the submission in all criteria.

Marks for submissions are to be viewed as being awarded for efforts achieved and delivered beyond the minimum expectation outlined in the specification. Reading the rubric alongside the specification will give you the best opportunity to understand how to maximise your grades in this course provided the submissions are up to an exceptional standard (consideration to your skill level is accounted for by the marking team).
