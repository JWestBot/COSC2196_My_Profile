              <p>
              When I was a child my family had a Vic-20 which was upgraded to a Commodore-64, but it was a family friend who was a computer technician that first introduced me to computers properly, explaining hardware and DOS commands,  and I've been exploring the world of IT since and it is everywhere.
              <br>
              <br>
              I currently work in an IT related position as a Business Systems Analyst at RMIT University and have been working with computers for over 20 years, but I don't have any formal qualifications. So it seems like the best opportunity I have ever had to chase away some self-doubt, fill in some knowledge gaps, learn some new things, ensure my career doesn’t stagnate and keep my skills relevant.
              <br>
              <br>
              By studying at RMIT, I feel like I’m supporting the University that is currently supporting me as an employee, it was an easy choice to study at RMIT.
              <br>
              <br>
              I’m a bit of an all-rounder, I know how to do a lot of things in the world of IT, but I’m not a master at any of them. I’m hoping through the Bachelor of Information Technology I discover an area that piques my interest and I can work at mastering it.

              <h2>Senior Analyst – Strategy and Implementation</h2>
                <h3>Description</h3>
                  <p>
                  This appears to be a strategic roll at Bunnings, analysing the existing business needs and sales targets, systems and processes currently in place, working with many stakeholders including a dedicated Salesforce CRM team, Operations and Sales Teams and designing a Sales Pipeline and Reporting function that is fit for purpose.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  The Bunnings brand isn’t a massive drawcard for this job, its all about the role. The possibility of leading and working on a strategic systems based project from start to finish is what I find most appealing. The role has many similarities to a User Experience Developer but with a more Business based focus. From scoping out the initial needs, researching and putting together a business case and proposal and then delivering the end product is the level I would like to aim for.
