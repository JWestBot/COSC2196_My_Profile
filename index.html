        <p>
        My father migrated from England with his parents and siblings when he was still a teenager, my mother was born in Australia with her paternal lineage migrating from England in the early 1800’s as a tradesperson. I was born in Northern NSW and grew up in the NSW high country of the New England region. I completed high school and started a Commerce degree at the University of New England, but I couldn’t juggle work, study and life at the time. I’m back studying now that I’m in a better position to succeed. I’m also a musician, songwriter and producer. I sang in a metal band in London UK, and toured the East Cost of Australia with an electronic shoegaze band called No Body Died. These days I release electro pop music under my own name Jay Westfold, minimal ambient techno under the name Broken Ballerina, and play synths in a post-punk band. To date my music has received over 50k streams on Spotify and Apple Music.

              <p>
              When I was a child my family had a Vic-20 which was upgraded to a Commodore-64, but it was a family friend who was a computer technician that first introduced me to computers properly, explaining hardware and DOS commands,  and I've been exploring the world of IT since and it is everywhere.
              <br>
              <br>
              I currently work in an IT related position as a Business Systems Analyst at RMIT University and have been working with computers for over 20 years, but I don't have any formal qualifications. So it seems like the best opportunity I have ever had to chase away some self-doubt, fill in some knowledge gaps, learn some new things, ensure my career doesn’t stagnate and keep my skills relevant.
              <br>
              <br>
              By studying at RMIT, I feel like I’m supporting the university that is currently supporting me as an employee, it was an easy choice to study at RMIT.
              <br>
              <br>
              I’m a bit of an all-rounder, I know how to do a lot of things in the world of IT, but I’m not a master at any of them. I’m hoping through the Bachelor of Information Technology I discover an area that piques my interest and I can work at mastering it.

              <h2>Senior Analyst – Strategy and Implementation</h2>
                <h3>Description</h3>
                  <p>
                  The <a href="https://au.linkedin.com/jobs/view/senior-analyst-strategy-and-implementation-at-bunnings-2929585735" target="_blank">Senior Analyst - Strategy and Implementation [1]</a> role is a strategic roll at Bunnings, analysing the existing business needs, sales targets, systems and processes currently in place, working with many stakeholders including a dedicated Salesforce CRM team, Operations and Sales Teams and designing a Sales Pipeline and Reporting function that is fit for purpose.

The role has many similarities to a User Experience Developer but with a more Business based focus. From scoping out the initial needs, researching and putting together a business case and proposal and then delivering the end product is the level I would like to aim for.

              <h2>Results</h2>
                <h3>Meaning</h3>
                <p>
                I consider myself to be emotionally intelligent, it hasn’t always been the case, but I have learnt and continue to learn about myself and how I interact with the environment and the people I encounter every day. I am aware that I am introverted, but I also know that I have strong social and communication skills. I’m aware that I often underplay my achievements and have a hard time accepting compliments from others, but being aware of it allows me the chance to improve and get better at it. The 16personalities [2] personality test results confirmed these thoughts. I was a little surprised with the Education Planner Learning Style Self-Assessment [3] results, I find I’m much better with written instructions and being allowed the time to explore concepts and information on my own first, but hearing and listening is a great way of validating information for me. So I don’t think it is a clear cut as being an Auditory learner, I think a combination of styles suits me best. On the final test that I tried, the Personality Quiz on PsychCentral [4] I am told that I am seen as the Lively Centre of Attention by others, if that is true than I am quietly surprised, but maybe that is the point.
                </p>
                <h3>Behaviours</h3>
                <p>
                Different personality types work differently with each other in teams, being aware and conscious of other personality and learning types as well as your own will give you the best chance of succeeding in a team situation. However having complimentary personality and learning types together in teams, not all the same types of people, would be the best way of ensuring success.
                </p>
                <h3>Forming A Team</h3>
                <p>
                On any project different tasks can be suited to people with different skills and personality traits and types of learning. When forming a team, I will be trying to find team members that compliment my own traits, skills and learning type. For instance, I’m not someone that would be the first person to stand up in front of a group of people and present my findings from these tests. I would more likely be someone who observes others first and when I am comfortable and have a better understanding of the people in the room and I feel safe, I will then be able to present. So I will be drawn to more balanced, introverted and reserved people rather than extroverted people as I will have more confidence that I will have space and time to contribute and use my experience to get the best out of myself and the wider team.

              <h2>Founder CRM</h2>
                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                The cost of a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system can be out of reach for startups and new small businesses, yet capturing new business leads to form a sales pipeline is imperative for growth. Founder CRM is the project name for an open source CRM system. The CRM would contain a simple relational database set up for startups and new small businesses to capture business leads, contacts and organisations along with their products and price books. It would also capture the interactions between the business and those records. There would be a simple, light customer interface that would be easy to use and logical to understand for the business user.  The system would grow with the customer and Phase 2 would be the commercialisation of the product, allowing customers to add additional modules that would be available with an annual subscription fee.
                </p>
                <h3>Motivation</h3>
                <p>
                <a href="https://fundsquire.com.au/business-startup-statistics-australia/#:~:text=Between%20FY%2018%2D19%3A,market%2C%20making%20up%20293%2C260%20exits." target="_blank">FundSquire</a> reports that for the 2018-19 financial year Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) provided almost half of Australia’s employment, in that same period 355,722 new businesses entered the market, 293,260 businesses exited the market leaving a net growth of 62,462 new businesses for the period [5]. The Australian Bureau of Statistics reports that more than 60 percent of small businesses stop their operation with the first three years of their startup journey, 29% fail because they run out of cash, 18% fail because of pricing and cost issues, 17% fail because they lack a business model, 14% fail because of poor marketing and 14% fail because they ignored their customers [6]. Founder CRM can help by reducing costs as the initial offering will be offered free of charge to startups, it can also help in the areas of business modelling, marketing and customer service by providing the startup with business insight and oversight of their business leads and sales pipeline. Having worked with various CRMs for many years, I’m a passionate advocate for their implementation in any business setting, especially in a startups formative years.
                </p>
                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>
                In Phase 1, Founder CRM will feature a JavaScript web application as the front-end user interface and an SQL relational database to store the user entered data. As the target market for the CRM is startups and new businesses the CRM will not have mass data import functionality out of the box, instead it will focus on providing an application that can handle user input of data only. The front-end interface of the application will have a home page and a page for business leads (Seeds), organisations, contacts and opportunities as well as a settings page to set up products.
                <br>
                <br>
                <img src="images/Founder CRM Data Structure Diagram.png" alt="CRM Data Structure Diagram." style="width:100%; height:auto;"/>


                <b>Seed</b>
                <br>
                A business lead will be referred to as a Seed. A Seed can be in 4 different states, 'New' for a newly user entered lead; 'Cultivate' for leads that have been responsive; 'Dormant' for leads that are no longer being pursued and are considered closed but could be opened up at a later date; 'Connected' for leads that have a confirmed interest in the startups products/services, upon reaching this state the Seed will create an Organisation, Contact and an Opportunity. The Seed can be matched to existing Organisations and Contacts in the database to prevent duplication of data via a lookup function.  The Seeds page will show a list of all Seed records in the database, by default it will show only Seeds with a status of New or Cultivate, however there will be a filter function available to either show all Seeds in any state or focus in on a state of the users choosing. The Seeds page will also include a button to create a new Seed record and a button to delete a Seed record.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Organisation, Contact</b>
                <br>
                The Organisations and Contacts pages will show lists of records in the database.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Opportunity</b>
                <br>
                An Opportunity can be in 5 different states, ‘New’ for a newly connected opportunity; ‘Scoping’ for an opportunity that is currently being researched and explored; ‘Pitching’ for an opportunity that is fully formed and being pitched to the organisation; ‘Won’ for an opportunity that has been successful; ‘Lost’ for an opportunity that has been unsuccesful. The Opportunities page will show a list of all Opportunity records in the database, by default it will show only Opportunities with a status of New, Scoping or Pitching, however there will a filter function available to either show all Opportunities in any state or focus in on a state of the users choosing. The Opportunity can include products or services from the Product list.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Product</b>
                <br>
                Products can be added by the user in the Settings section of the application. A product could be a product or a service and will include a price per unit (can be zero for non-financial products or services) and GST.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Home</b>
                <br>
                The home page will feature a simple dashboard that will show the total Open Seeds (New, Cultivate), Dormant Seeds, Connected Seeds and the total Open Opportunities (New, Scoping, Pitching), Won Opportunities, Lost Opportunities.
                <br>
                <br>
                Phase 2 would explore additional functionality such as an import/export data function, Microsoft Outlook API Integration using Microsoft Developer Console, web-to-seed integration capability with e-commerce websites, a Native Report function and data visualisation through standard dashboards.
                </p>
                <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
                <p>
                Building the front-end application written in JavaScript and the SQL relational database would require an open sourced text and source code editor such as Atom, with the ‘data-atom’ package installed, and a tool such as GitHub for collaboration with the development team. Once the application source code has been built engaging a Private Cloud provider to host data may be required. Office 365 would be required to create a business and marketing plan. The marketing plan may include the need for an e-marketing platform such as mail-chimp. A website for marketing purposes would also need to be built, this could be built using the same open sourced text and source code editor and GitHub, the Private Cloud provider may also be able to provide a hosting service for the website.
                <h3>Skills Required</h3>
                <p>
                The project may require the services of a full-stack developer or a team of developers that could cover front-end, back-end and database development. A UX developer may be needed to ensure the application is being created with the user experience in mind. A cloud architect may need to be consulted to ensure the data can be safely housed and accessed in the cloud. A cyber security analyst may need to be consulted to ensure data is secure. A marketing specialist may be required to advise on the marketability of the project, the building and delivery of a marketing and communications plan, they may also be able to contribute to the website built. Finding individuals with these skills might be difficult, learning the skills may be a possibility over many years, engaging with specialist consultants in each of these areas would be costly. If the project was to engage a startup incubator such as RMIT Activator and was successful in entering the LaunchHub program, the project could gain access to people with the skills that could assist in bringing the project to life.
                </p>
                <h3>Outcome</h3>
                <p>
                A successful outcome would be a working open source CRM product built on the foundations of a solid and well thought out business, marketing and communications plans ready to launch to market with an e-commerce website. It will provide Australian startups with a simple to use, functioning CRM to manage their sales pipeline without the burden of an expensive CRM that may provide more functionality than what is required in the early stages of a startup.
